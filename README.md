## 💡 Inspiration

Millions in rural India lack access to timely, reliable healthcare. At the same time, Ayurveda offers a natural and culturally trusted healing system — but it’s often inaccessible or unstructured. Luna bridges that gap by delivering personalized Ayurvedic guidance right to the user’s phone — in their own language.

1. User signs up via Google or email
2. Selects preferred language
3. Types or speaks a symptom
4. Luna responds with verified Ayurvedic remedies
5. Additional tools like hospital finder, lessons, and FAQs enhance the experience
