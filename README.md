💡 Inspiration
Millions of people in rural India face limited access to healthcare and trustworthy medical advice. At the same time, there’s growing interest in natural, side-effect-free healing — like Ayurveda — yet verified guidance is hard to find in local languages. Luna was built to close that gap.

🛠️ How It Works
Users sign up or log in via Google.

They select their preferred language.

Users enter symptoms via text or voice.

Luna provides Ayurvedic remedies instantly, along with contextual advice.

Additional tools like hospital locators, FAQs, and lessons support a holistic user experience.

🤯 Challenges We Faced
Training the AI to understand natural symptom descriptions across languages.

Structuring and validating Ayurvedic data for safe, contextual use.

Keeping the app fast and lightweight for low-end devices and poor connectivity zones.

Balancing a simple UI with multi-feature functionality.

🌈 What's Next
Expand language support to more regional dialects.

Add voice output for full hands-free experience.

Integrate teleconsultation with certified Ayurvedic doctors.

Enhance offline functionality with local caching.
